# bpglm R-package

There is a growing interest in analyzing bivariate count outcomes with covariate dependence.  The bivariate Poisson models have emerged to address a wide range of applications in various fields where paired count data are correlated. Leiter and Hamadan [1] suggested bivariate probability models applicable to traffic accidents and fatalities. The bivariate Poisson distribution has been proposed using various assumptions. Among those, the most comprehensive one has been developed by Kocherlakota and Kocherlakota [2]. Islam and Chowdhury [3],  Chowdhury and Islam [4] and Islam and Chowdhury [5] developed untruncated and zero-truncated and right truncated bivariate Poisson model for covariate dependence based on the extended generalized linear model. The package (bpglm) is developed to fit those models.  This package could also be used to fit model for multivariate outcomes and theory is presented in the book on _Analysis of repeated measures data_ [6]. One can fit full model with varying number of covariates and likelihood ratio test could be performed for model selection. Also, Voung test [7] is available for model comparison.
